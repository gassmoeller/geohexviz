# Example 3: World War 3 Bombings
The next example concerns a data set containing the locations of World War 2 bombings.
The data was taken from Kaggle [[1]](#1) and split into the years 1943, 1944, and 1945 â€” collectively these years contain 155175 bombing events in the data.
The output visualization depicts the total mass of bombs dropped in each of these years.
