# Example 1: Search and Rescue
The first example concerns a data set containing the locations of SAR incidents over the Canadian landmass.
In the reference document published alongside this package, this example consists of real SAR data.
For the purposes of this publication, an Excel spreadsheet was populated with random latitudes and longitudes, and then was compiled into a .csv file.
The output visualization depicts the density of these randomly generated locations.
