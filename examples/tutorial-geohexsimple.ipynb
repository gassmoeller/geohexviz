    "## Using the GeoHexSimple script\n",
    "GeoHexSimple includes a script that can be used to generate plots that are represented in file form.\n",
    "Running the script is as easy as running the:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "geohexsimple\n",
    "```\n",
    "command in a terminal.\n",
    "The script has many options including:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "-h, --help            show this help message and exit\n",
    "-p PATH, --path PATH  path to json file or directory containing json files\n",
    "-g, --gui             enable command-line gui (default true)\n",
    "-nf, --nofeedback     turn off feedback while plotting\n",
    "-v, --verbose         whether to raise all errors or not\n",
    "```\n",
    "The PATH argument is required if no GUI is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plot structure definition\n",
    "A JSON file will be used to depict the structure of a file containing plot properties.\n",
    "Internally the `run_file` function is used, and it reads valid files into a key-value style format (dict).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When read, GeoHexSimple creates a PlotBuilder object that will be passed the contents of the structure definition.\n",
    "The plot structue definition should start with defining the arguments that are used to set the hexbin layer.\n",
    "This is done by adding the `hexbin_layer` clause to the structure.\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"hexbin_layer\": {\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    },\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, any optional layers should be specified.\n",

    "```\n",
    "The clauses `regions`, `outlines`, `grids`, and `points` do not specify layers themselves, but isntead contain a list of key-value pairs that define layers to add.\n",
    "To reiterate, each key-value pair of the `regions` clause is a region layer, where the key is the name of the layer, and the value is a clause containing the parameters for the setting of that layer.\n",
    "See other examples to gain a deeper understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other very advanced items can be specified at this point in the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the any functions to be applied can be specified through the `functions` clause.\n",
    "Each key-value pair in this clause is a function, where the key refers to the name of the function, and the value contains the arguments passed to the function.\n",

    "     },\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `clip_layers` function is invoked when the `functions` clause is parsed.\n",

    "Finally, the visualization can be output or displayed in the browser.\n",
    "To output, add the `output` member to the structure.\n",
