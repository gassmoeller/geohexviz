# Example 2: Mass Shootings
In the following example, a data set containing the locations of mass shootings in the United States of America is passed into GeoHexViz.\footnote{A mass shooting is defined as a shooting in which four or more individuals were shot or killed, not including the shooter \citep{gun-data}.}
Each row in the data set contains the number of people killed and injured in the incident.
The data was taken from Gun Violence Archive [[1]](#1) and contains 2001 incidents from July 30th 2017 to September 14th 2021.
The output visualization depicts the sum of people killed or injured per hexagon.
